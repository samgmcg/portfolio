                <p class="para sweep-l yellow">Peter shire is a furniture artist and sculptor from the United States. His work is notably without genre, and he prides himself on working outside of preconceived norms. He crosses not only styles, but also media and techniques, spreading his handiwork from drawing and painting to the more marginalized fields of furniture, ceramics, and various styles of toys.</p>
                <p class="para sweep-r green">While his work tends to be atypical, Shire draws various inspiration from the rich heritage of his twentieth century predecesors and offers reference in his work to Bauhaus, Futurism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco. Shire's pieces take out the traditional ideas of composition and form in favor of a unique sense of playfulness and excitement, a reflection of Shire's own personality.</p>
                <p class="para sweep-l purple">Shire was one of the original members of the Memphis group, an international design movement that came out of Italy during the 1980's, alongside Ettore Sottsass. Along with the other members of Memphis, Shire sought to reject conventional standards in favor of a bold, colorful, novel approach to product design, which can be seen in his furniture, sculpture, and various product designs. While working with Memphis, much of Shire's work walked the thine between industrial design and fine art, working with such new media as glass and metal, while maintaining his unique playfulness and colorful styling.</p>
                <p class="para sweep-r red">Some of Shire's earliest inspiration he attributes to his father's concern with craftmaanship, which Shire learned while working in his furniture design and manufacture business and had a powerful impact on his artistic views. Born and raised in Los Angeles, the many cultures and styles of his hometown allowed Shire to think creatively not only about his art but also about his approach to design itself.</p>
                <p class="para sweep-l blue">Shire holds an impressive record of museum collections and solo exhibitions, including numerous shows in his hometown of L.A., as well as international offerings in Milan, Paris, Tokyo, and Sapporo. His work is also displayed in many public collections in the U.S. and abroad, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. He holds a Bachelors of Fine Arts from Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles.</p>
